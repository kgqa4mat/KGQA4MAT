# Knowledge Graph Question Answering for Materials Science (KGQA4MAT)
## A Benchmark for Developing Natural Language Interface for Metal-Organic Frameworks Knowledge Graph (MOF-KG)

We develop a novel benchmark for NL question answering over a knowledge graph for Metal-Organic
Frameworks (MOFs). 

The MOF knowledge graph (MOF-KG) is built by integrating structured databases and knowledge extracted from 
the literature. The graph is stored in a Neo4j database. To enable domain experts to ask NL questions from the MOF-KG, 
we develop a natural language interface leveraging ChatGPT to tranlate NL questions to Cypher queries. In this study, we
demonstrate the potential of our approach through the benchmark dataset and the well-known QALD-9 dataset.
